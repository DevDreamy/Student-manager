# Student Manager

This project was based on a JavaScript course, using ReactJS.
You can access the Rest API that works behind the scene as the backend for this project at this repository:
[**Rest API - Student Manager**](https://github.com/DevDreamy/Student-manager-rest-api)

**This is not an actual app**, it's just for my portfolio and even though it uses some security to maintain your personal data safe (like hashing your password) I still highly recommend that you **don’t use real information when creating or editing your user account or students**.

### What you can do:
It’s possible to create an account and with it you can create, edit or delete students, you can also upload a profile picture for each registered student. It’s possible to edit your own information (such as name, e-mail and password).


#### Some changes I’ve made from the original project of the course:
-	Implemented a new navbar with cool effects.
-	Implemented responsive design.
-	Reduced the number of error alerts shown when invalid information was submitted, showing one alert with all error messages instead of one alert for each invalid information submitted.
-	Implemented a confirmation screen to appear when deleting students.
-	Changed the “Novo Aluno” link to a button.
-	Changed the colors to make it beautiful.
